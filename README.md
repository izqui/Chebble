Memoface (Formerly Chebble)
==========

Memoface is a Pebble watchface with a hidden feature.  Memoface in fact, allows you to save a note on your pebble and watch it later when you need it. 

You have to make a quick move to see the text and smoothly move the watch to scroll the text.
When you want to hide the text , simply make another quick motion.

Memoface works with Pebble 3.X.
